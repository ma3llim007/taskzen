# Task Management App

## Overview

This is a Task Management App built with **React** and **Redux Toolkit**. The app allows users to add, view, delete, and organize tasks across three columns: Todo, Doing, and Done. The app supports drag-and-drop functionality to move tasks between columns. It also integrates with **Redux Persist** to store tasks in local storage, ensuring that the state persists between sessions.

## Features

-   **Add New Task**: Create a new task with a title and status (Todo, Doing, Done).
-   **Drag and Drop**: Move tasks between columns (Todo, Doing, Done) using drag-and-drop.
-   **Delete Task**: Remove a task from the list.
-   **Persistent State**: Task data is saved in local storage using **Redux Persist**.
-   **Responsive Design**: Works well on different screen sizes and devices.
